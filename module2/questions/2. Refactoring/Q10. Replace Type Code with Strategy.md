## Question 2

This is a list of the benefits of **Replace Type Code with Strategy**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Runtime type changes** - can change behavior during object lifetime
2. **Eliminates conditionals** - no if/switch statements on type
3. **Composition over inheritance** - more flexible than subclassing
4. **Multiple variations** - can vary along multiple dimensions
5. **Strategy reuse** - strategies can be shared among objects
6. **Reduces the number of classes** â€” Strategy often decreases the number of classes for flexibility

## Question 3

(T/F) This explains the main difference between Replace Type Code with Subclass and Replace Type Code with Strategy correctly.

**Subclass**: Uses **inheritance**, type is **fixed at creation**, object cannot change type.
**Strategy**: Uses **composition**, type can **change at runtime**, more flexible but slightly more complex.
