# Q16. Tease Apart Inheritance

---

## Question 1

What is this refactoring?

Split an **overloaded inheritance hierarchy** into **separate hierarchies**, linked by **composition** or **delegation**.

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 2

When is **Tease Apart Inheritance** refactoring needed?  

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 3

What design pattern is closely related to Tease Apart Inheritance in that we choose to use composition over inheritance to solve the EoC (Explosion of Classes) problem.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

This is a list of the benefits of **Tease Apart Inheritance**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Single Responsibility** - each hierarchy handles one concern
2. **Reduces duplication** - eliminates duplicate code across branches
3. **Better extensibility** - can vary each dimension independently
4. **Composition flexibility** - can combine different aspects at runtime
5. **Prevents class explosion** - linear growth instead of combinatorial
6. **Improves raw performance** — Tease Apart Inheritance improves design clarity, not speed  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

How does teasing apart inheritance prevent combinatorial explosion?

Before: **N × M** classes (N vehicle types × M engine types)
After: **N + M** classes (N vehicle classes + M engine classes)

Example with 3 vehicle types and 3 engine types:
Before: **??** classes
After: **??** classes

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

(T/F) Tease Apart Inheritance always results in two inheritance hierarchies.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

What design principle does Tease Apart Inheritance follow?

---

**Answer:**
