# Q14. Replace Inheritance with Delegation

---

## Question 14.1

When should you replace inheritance with delegation?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 14.2

This is a list of drawbacks of **inheritance**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Tight coupling** - subclass depends on superclass implementation details
2. **Breaks encapsulation** - subclass can access protected members
3. **Fragile base class** - changes to superclass can break subclasses
4. **Interface pollution** - subclass inherits methods it doesn't need
5. **Multiple inheritance conflicts** - diamond problem in some languages
6. **Always improves flexibility** — inheritance can actually enhances flexibility by locking in hierarchies  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 14.3

What are the benefits of replacing inheritance with delegation?

1. **Loose coupling** - delegating class only depends on interface
2. **Flexible composition** - can change delegate at runtime
3. **Selective interface** - expose only needed methods
4. **Better encapsulation** - delegate's internals are hidden
5. **Easier testing** - can mock the delegate
6. **Eliminates the need for interfaces** — delegation usually removes interfaces

**Answer:**


---

## Question 14.4

(T/F) Delegation always provides better performance than inheritance.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 14.7

This principle suggests using **composition (delegation)** as the primary way to reuse code, reserving **inheritance** only for true **"is-a"** relationships where polymorphism is needed.

What is this principle?

**Answer:**
