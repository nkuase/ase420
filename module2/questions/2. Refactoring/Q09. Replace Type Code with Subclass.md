# Q09. Replace Type Code with Subclass

---

## Question 9.1

What is this refactoring?

Replace a **type code that affects behavior** with **subclasses**, each implementing the specific behavior.  

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 9.2

The **type code affects the object’s behavior** and you have **conditional logic** that varies based on the type code. In this case what refactoring should you consider?

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 9.3

This is a list of the benefits of **Replace Type Code with Subclass**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Eliminates conditionals** - no more if/switch statements on type
2. **Polymorphism** - behavior varies automatically by type
3. **Open/Closed Principle** - can add new types without changing existing code
4. **Type safety** - compiler ensures correct method calls
5. **Clearer intent** - each subclass has a single, clear purpose
5. **Allows type to change at runtime** — if the type must change dynamically, use Subclass

**Answer:**


---

## Question 9.4

What is a potential drawback of **Replace Type Code with Subclass**?  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Cannot change type at runtime** — once created as a subclass, the type is fixed  
2. Must manage **more classes** — each type requires a separate subclass  
3. Can lead to **rigid hierarchy** — harder to refactor if types evolve  
4.**Prevents polymorphism** — *disable* polymorphism  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 9.5

(T/F) Replace Type Code with Subclass is appropriate when an object needs to change its type during its lifetime.

**Answer:**
