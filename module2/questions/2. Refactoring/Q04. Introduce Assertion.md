---

## Question 4.1

This is a list of statements about **assertions**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. An assertion is a **statement** that checks if a condition is true at runtime  
2. Assertions are used to **validate assumptions** about program state  
3. Assertions help **catch programming errors early**  
4. Assertions are meant for **handling runtime exceptions in production**

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4.2

This is a list of when you should introduce **assertions** in your code.  
Which one is **wrong**?

- When you have **assumptions** about program state
- When you want to **document preconditions** and postconditions
- When you need to **catch programming errors** early
- When you want to **validate input parameters**
- When you want to **handle runtime errors in production**

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4.3

Complete the assertion example:

Before (no assertion):

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```

After (with assertion):

```python
def divide(a, b):
    ??(b != 0, "Divisor cannot be zero")
    return a / b
```

## Question 4.5

This is a list of the benefits of introducing **assertions**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Early error detection** - catches bugs closer to their source
2. **Documentation** - makes assumptions explicit
3. **Debugging aid** - helps identify where problems occur
4. **Code reliability** - increases confidence in code correctness
5. **Improves runtime performance** â€” assertions optimize performance
