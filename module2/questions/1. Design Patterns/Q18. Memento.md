---

## Question 1

What pattern explains this idea?

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 2

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 3

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

This is a list of when we should use the **Memento pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

- When you need to **save and restore** object state
- When **direct access** to state would violate encapsulation
- For implementing **undo/redo** functionality
- For **checkpointing** and **rollback** operations
- When state must be saved **externally** to the object
- When you need to **share intrinsic state among many objects**

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

This is a list of the benefits of the **Memento pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Preserves encapsulation** - doesn't expose internal structure
2. **Simplifies originator** - doesn't need to manage multiple versions
3. **Recovery capability** - can restore to previous states
4. **Isolation** - caretaker doesn't need to know about state details
5. **Minimizes memory usage** - Memory usage is reduced

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

This is a list of potential drawbacks of the **Memento pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Memory overhead** - storing multiple states can use lots of memory
2. **Performance cost** - creating and storing mementos can be expensive
3. **Hidden costs** - caretaker might not know the cost of storing mementos
4. **Large state objects** - difficult with objects that have large internal state
5. **Prevents restoring state** â€” restoring is hard with Memento

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

(T/F) This is the difference between Memento and Command pattern for undo functionality.

**Memento**: Stores **object states**, restores by setting state, good for complex state.  
**Command**: Stores **operations**, undoes by executing reverse operations, good for simple operations.
