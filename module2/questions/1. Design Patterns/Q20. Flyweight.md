# Q20. Flyweight Pattern

---

## Question 20.1

To minimize memory usage by sharing efficiently stored data among multiple similar objects, separating intrinsic (shared) state from extrinsic (context-specific) state.  

What pattern explains this idea?

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 20.2

(T/F) This is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic state.

**Intrinsic state**: **Shared** among multiple objects, stored in the flyweight, **context-independent**.  
**Extrinsic state**: **Unique** to each object, passed to flyweight methods, **context-dependent**.  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.3

This is a list of the main participants in the **Flyweight pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Flyweight** - interface for flyweights to receive and act on extrinsic state
2. **ConcreteFlyweight** - implements Flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state
3. **FlyweightFactory** - creates and manages flyweight objects, ensures sharing
4. **Context** - maintains references to flyweights and stores extrinsic state
5. **Invoker** — invokes signal to the flightweight  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.4

(T/F) Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by eliminating duplicate objects.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.5

This is a list of when we should use the **Flyweight pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

- When you need to create a **large number of similar objects**
- When **memory usage** is a concern
- When objects can be **divided into intrinsic and extrinsic state**
- When **groups of objects** can be replaced by fewer shared objects
- When extrinsic state can be **computed or passed** rather than stored
- When you want to **encapsulate state-specific behavior**

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.6

This is a list of the benefits of the **Flyweight pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Reduces memory usage** - shares objects instead of duplicating
2. **Improves performance** - fewer objects to create and garbage collect
3. **Centralized state management** - intrinsic state managed in one place
4. **Scalability** - can handle large numbers of objects efficiently
5. **Simplifies object behavior** — flyweight focuses on simplifying behavior  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.7

This is a list of potential drawbacks of the **Flyweight pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Complexity** - need to separate intrinsic from extrinsic state
2. **Runtime costs** - computing extrinsic state might be expensive
3. **Synchronization issues** - shared flyweights need thread safety
4. **Not always beneficial** - overhead might not be worth it for small numbers of objects
5. **Encapsulates state-specific behavior** — always get the states easily for flyweight actions

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 20.8

(T/F) This is the difference between Flyweight and Singleton pattern.

**Flyweight**: **Multiple instances** sharing the same intrinsic state, **factory manages** instances, focuses on **memory optimization**.  
**Singleton**: **Single instance** globally, **class manages** its own instance, focuses on **single access point**.

**Answer:**
