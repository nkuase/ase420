---

## Question 1.1

It allows us to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the internal structure of the aggregation.

What is the main problem that this pattern solves?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.2

In the code `for i in [1,2,3,4,5]: print(i)`, why is this considered "smelly" code according to the Iterator pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.3

(T/F) In the Iterator pattern, the aggregate should create the iterator conceptually, but the iterator should own the aggregate for easy implementation.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.4

In the BookShelf example, what are the main abstract players in the Iterator pattern?

1. **??1** (Abstract Bookshelf)
2. **??2** (Abstract)

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.5

Complete the main method steps for using the Iterator pattern:

Step 1: Create a bookshelf and add books

book_shelf.append_book(Book("..."))
```

Step 2: **??**

```python
??
```

Step 3: **??**

```python
while ??:
    book = ??
```

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.6

(T/F) When using the Iterator pattern, we need to know the details of the aggregation, such as the size or an index.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.7

What are the two essential methods that an iterator must provide?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.8

Rewrite this syntactic sugar code into the explicit iterator usage.

Syntactic sugar:

```python
for i in it:
    print(i)
```

Explicit iterator:

???

why is it designed this way?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.11

What analogy is used to explain the relationship between the iterator and aggregate in a library context?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 1.12
