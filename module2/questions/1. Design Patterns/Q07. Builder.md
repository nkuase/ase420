# Q07. Builder Pattern

---

## Question 1

Which pattern solves the problem of:

- Constructing **complex objects step by step**  
- Handling **many optional parameters**  
- Enforcing a **specific construction sequence**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 2

What are the main three participants in the Builder pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

---

## Question 4

Complete the Builder pattern implementation:

```python
class HouseBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.house = House()
    
    def build_foundation(self):
        # Build foundation
        return ??  # For method chaining
    
    def build_walls(self):
        # Build walls
        return ??
    
    def get_result(self):
        return ??.house
```

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

What is method chaining (fluent interface) in the Builder pattern?

```python
house = HouseBuilder() \
    .??() \
    .??() \
    .??() \
    .get_result()
```

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

??? controls the construction sequence and defines the steps needed to build a product. It uses the Builder interface but doesn't know about concrete products.

Whose role of this in the Builder pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

(T/F) The Builder pattern is only useful for objects with many constructor parameters.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 8

This is a list of the benefits of the **Builder pattern**.  
Which one is **NOT** correct?

1. **Clear construction process** - step-by-step building
2. **Flexible object creation** - different representations possible
3. **Eliminates telescoping constructors** - cleaner parameter handling
4. **Immutable objects** - can create immutable products
5. **Reusable construction logic** - director can be reused
6. **Guarantees only one instance** â€” simplifying the build process

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 9

This is a list of when we should use the **Builder pattern**. Which one is **wrong**?

- When creating **complex objects** with many parameters
- When construction requires **multiple steps** in a specific order
- When you need **different representations** of the same object
- When you want to create **immutable objects** with many fields
- To avoid **telescoping constructors**
- When you want to **guarantee only one instance** of a class

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 10

(T/F) This is correct explanation of the difference between Builder and Abstract Factory patterns.

**Builder**: Constructs a complex object **step by step**, focuses on **how** the object is built.
**Abstract Factory**: Creates **families of related objects** all at once, focuses on **what** objects are created.

**Answer:**
