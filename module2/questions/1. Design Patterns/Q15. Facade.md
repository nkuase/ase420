# Q15. Facade Pattern

---

## Question 15.1

To provide a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and reducing dependencies on subsystem classes.  

What pattern explains this idea?

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 15.2

What problem does the Facade pattern solve?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 15.3

We simplified the operation of DVD player & amp. What pattern do we use?

```python
# Before
amplifier = Amplifier()
amplifier.turn_on()
amplifier.set_volume(10)
dvd = DvdPlayer()
dvd.turn_on()
dvd.play("Inception")

# After

theater = HomeTheaterFacade()
theater.watch_movie("Inception")
```

## Question 15.4

(T/F) Facade pattern prevents clients from accessing subsystem classes directly if needed.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 15.5

This is a list of when we should use the **Facade pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

- When you want to provide a **simple interface** to a complex subsystem
- When you want to **decouple clients** from subsystem classes  
- When you want to **layer your subsystems** (facade as entry point to each layer)
- When you need to **dynamically add responsibilities**

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question6

This is a list of the benefits of the **Facade pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Simplified interface** - easier to use than subsystem
2. **Reduced coupling** - clients depend on facade, not subsystem classes
3. **Improved readability** - high-level operations are clear
4. **Encapsulation** - hides subsystem complexity
5. **Promotes layering** - clear separation between layers
6. **Allows dynamic behavior extension** â€” dynamic reponse update

**Answer:**


---

## Question 15.6

When we use a compiler example, it provides lexer, parser, and other tools behind the scene. What pattern do we use?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 15.7

(T/F) This explains the difference between Facade and Adapter patterns correctly.

**Facade**: Provides **simplified interface** to complex subsystem, **optional** usage.
**Adapter**: Makes **incompatible interfaces** work together, **necessary** for compatibility.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 15.8

**God object risk** - the pattern might become too large and complex if it tries to handle too many responsibilities. Should focus on providing a cohesive, simplified interface rather than becoming a catch-all class.

What potential drawback should you consider with this pttern?
