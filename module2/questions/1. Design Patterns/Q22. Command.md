# Q22. Command Pattern

---
## Question 1

To encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize objects with different requests, queue operations, log requests, and support undo operations.  

What pattern explains this idea?

---

**Answer:**  


---

## Question 2

What are the four (abstract) participants in the Command pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 3

In the Command patter, whose role is this?

- Creates orders
- Knows what to order
- Sets up the command-receiver relationship

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

In the Command patter, whose role is this?

- Encapsulates the request
- Binds receiver with action
- Contains all info needed

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

In the Command patter, whose role is this?

- Does the actual work
- Knows how to cook
- Performs the operation

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

In the Command patter, whose role is this?

- Manages commands
- Executes when ready
- Doesn't know cooking details

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

When should you use the Command pattern?

- When you need to **parameterize objects** with operations
- When you need to **queue, log, or schedule** operations
- When you need **undo/redo** functionality
- When you want to **decouple** invoker from receiver
- When you need to **support transactions** or **rollback**
- When you need to **share intrinsic state among many objects**

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 8

This is a list of the benefits of the **Command pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Decouples invoker from receiver** - invoker doesn't need to know receiver details
2. **Supports undo/redo** - commands can reverse their effects
3. **Enables queuing** - commands can be stored and executed later
4. **Supports logging** - can log and replay commands
5. **Composite commands** - can combine simple commands into complex ones
6. **Minimizes memory usage** — Command always requires storing minimal objects, so memory use can be optimal

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 9

What are potential drawbacks of the Command pattern?

1. **Increased complexity** - many small command classes
2. **Memory overhead** - storing command objects and their state
3. **Performance impact** - extra layer of indirection
4. **Debugging difficulty** - harder to trace command execution flow
5. **Prevents adding new operations** — Command makes adding new operations harder  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 10

(T/F) This is the difference between Command and Strategy pattern.

**Command**: **Encapsulates requests** as objects, focuses on **decoupling sender/receiver**, supports **undo/queuing**.
**Strategy**: **Encapsulates algorithms** as objects, focuses on **algorithm selection**, **no undo/queuing** typically.
