# Q11. Composite Pattern

---

## Question 11.1

To compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

What is the main purpose of the Composite pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11.2

It allows clients to work with **tree structures** without needing to distinguish between **leaf objects** and **composite objects** that contain other objects.

What pattern can solve this problem?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11.3

What are the two main participants in the Composite pattern that share the same interface.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11.4

(T/F) In Composite pattern, clients need to know whether they're working with a leaf (item) or composite (box) object.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11.5

How do you use the Composite pattern to get size? (Hint: add is used to add and get_size is used to get_size)

```python
# Create files
file1 = File("doc.txt", 100)
file2 = File("pic.jpg", 500)

# Create folders
folder = Folder("MyFolder")
folder.??(file1)
folder.??(file2)

# Treat folder like a file
total_size = folder.??()  # Works the same as file.get_size()
```

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11.6

What is the key principle behind the Composite pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question  7

- When you need to represent **part-whole hierarchies**
- When you want clients to **ignore differences** between single objects and compositions
- When you have **tree structures** in your domain
- When you want to apply operations **recursively** over a structure
- When you want to **guarantee only one instance** of a class

This is a list of when we should use the **Composite pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question  8

This is a list of the benefits of the **Composite pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Uniform treatment** — same interface for leaves and composites  
2. **Recursive composition** — can build complex trees  
3. **Simplified client code** — no need to distinguish object types  
4. **Easy to add new components** — both leaves and composites  
5. **Natural tree traversal** — operations work recursively  
6. **Guarantees dynamic algorithm update** — flexibility

**Answer:**

## Question 11.7

What is a potential drawback of the Composite pattern?

---

**Answer:**
