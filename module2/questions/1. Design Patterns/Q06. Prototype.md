# Q06. Prototype Pattern

---

## Question 1

Which patternâ€™s main purpose is to:

- Create new objects by **cloning existing instances**,  
- Instead of building them from scratch,  
- Especially when object creation is **costly**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 2

What interface must all prototypes implement?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 3

Out of the two types of cloning in the Prototype pattern, which copy explains `recursively copies the object and all referenced objects`?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

Complete the Prototype pattern implementation:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Prototype(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def ??(self):
        pass

class ConcretePrototype(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def ??(self):
        return ConcretePrototype(self.value)  # Shallow copy
```

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

- When object creation is **expensive** (complex initialization, database queries, network calls)
- When you need objects **similar to existing ones** with slight modifications
- When the **exact types** of objects to create are determined at runtime
- To avoid **subclassing** just for object creation
- When you want to **guarantee only one instance** of a class

This is a list of when we use the **Prototype pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

In Python, what built-in module supports the Prototype pattern?

```python
import ??
shallow_copy = ??.copy(original)
deep_copy = ??.deepcopy(original)
```

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

(T/F) The Prototype pattern eliminates the need for a complex inheritance hierarchy for object creation.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 8

**Prototype**: Can create objects without knowing their exact classes, especially useful when types are determined at runtime.
**Factory Method**: Requires knowledge of concrete classes and their creation logic.

(T/F) This explains the main benefit of using Prototype over Factory Method.

## Question 9

What challenge might you face when implementing deep copy in the Prototype pattern?
