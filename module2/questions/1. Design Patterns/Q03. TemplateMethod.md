# Q03. Template Method Pattern

---

## Question 1

What is the main purpose of the Template Method pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 2

In the Template Method pattern, what is the role of the abstract class?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 3

(T/F) In the Template Method pattern, subclasses can change the overall algorithm structure.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

What are the two types of methods typically found in a Template Method pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

This design pattern solves the problem by running step1, step2, and step3 methods consequently. Complete the Template Method example:

```python
class AbstractClass:
    def template_method(self):  # Template method
        self.step1()
        self.??2()
        self.??3()
    
    def step1(self):
        print("Default step 1")
    
    def ??2(self):  # Abstract method
        pass
    
    def ??3(self):  # Abstract method
        pass
```

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

What is a "hook method" in the Template Method pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

(T/F) The template method should typically be declared as final (non-overridable) to prevent subclasses from changing the algorithm structure.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 8

In this data processing example, the algorithm skeleton is already implemented in the super class, and we need to implement the detail implementation. What design pattern do we use in this example?

1. **Read data** (abstract - different sources)
2. **Process data** (abstract - different processing logic)
3. **Save data** (abstract - different destinations)
4. **Log completion** (concrete - same for all)

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 9

What principle does the Template Method pattern follow?

**Don't call us, we'll call you** the template method calls the subclass methods, not the other way around.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 10

These are the benefits of using the Template Method pattern. Which one is wrong?

1. **Code reuse** - common algorithm structure is shared
2. **Controlled extension** - subclasses can only change specific parts
3. **Eliminates code duplication** - common steps are implemented once
4. **Enforces algorithm structure** - ensures consistent workflow
5. **Controlled isolation** â€” subclasses extend only within the algorithm structure.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 11

When should you not use the Template Method pattern?

1. When you have multiple classes with similar algorithms that differ only in certain steps
2. When you want to control which parts of an algorithm can be extended
3. When you want to avoid code duplication in similar algorithms
4. When you want subclasses to have **complete freedom** to change the entire algorithm  

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 12

**Template Method**: Uses inheritance, defines algorithm skeleton in parent class, subclasses override specific steps.
**Strategy**: Uses composition, entire algorithms are interchangeable through different strategy objects.

(T/F) This is the main difference between Template Method and Strategy patterns.
