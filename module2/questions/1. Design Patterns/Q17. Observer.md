## Question 17.5

This is a list of when we should use the **Observer pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

- When changes to one object require **updating multiple objects**
- When objects should be **loosely coupled**
- When you want to **broadcast** communications
- When the set of observers **varies at runtime**
- When you need to **guarantee only one object reacts**

**Answer:**


---

## Question 17.6

This is a list of the benefits of the **Observer pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Loose coupling** - subject and observers are loosely coupled
2. **Dynamic relationships** - can add/remove observers at runtime
3. **Broadcast communication** - one change notifies many objects
4. **Open/Closed Principle** - can add new observers without changing subject
5. **Single Responsibility** - separates display logic from business logic
6. **Guarantees update order** — Observer guarantees the order of notifications

**Answer:**

## Question 17.7

This is a list of potential drawbacks of the **Observer pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

1. **Memory leaks** - observers not properly detached
2. **Unexpected updates** - observers might be notified in unexpected order
3. **Performance issues** - many observers can slow down notifications
4. **Complex update dependencies** - cascading updates can be hard to debug
5. **Prevents dynamic subscription** — updating is hard.
