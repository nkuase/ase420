# Q08. Abstract Factory Pattern

---

## Question 1

To provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

This explains the main purpose of this pattern. What is this?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 2

**Factory Method**: Creates **one type** of product using inheritance.
**Abstract Factory**: Creates **families of related products** using composition.

(T/F) This explains the difference between Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 3

What are the two abstract participants in the Abstract Factory pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 4

(T/F) The client in Abstract Factory pattern knows about concrete product classes.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5

What principle does the Abstract Factory pattern follow by depends upon abstractions only?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 6

- When you need to create **families of related objects**
- When you want to ensure objects from the same family are used together
- When you need to **switch between different product families** at runtime
- When you want to **isolate** product creation from product usage
- When you want to **build complex objects step by step**

This is a list of when we should use the **Abstract Factory pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 7

1. **Isolates concrete classes** - client doesn't depend on implementations
2. **Ensures product consistency** - products from same family work together
3. **Easy to switch families** - change factory to change entire product family
4. **Supports Open/Closed Principle** - can add new families without changing existing code
5. **Builds objects step by step** â€” can systemically make products.

This is a list of the benefits of the **Abstract Factory pattern**.  
Which one is **wrong**?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 8

What is a potential drawback of the Abstract Factory pattern?

---

**Answer:**
