# Q05. Singleton Pattern

---

## Question 5.1

Which pattern ensures that:

- A class has **only one instance**, and  
- Provides a **global point of access** to that instance?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.2

What is the (static) instance method for implementing the Singleton pattern?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.3

(T/F) The Singleton pattern guarantees that multiple threads will never create multiple instances simultaneously.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.4

This is one of the Key characteristics of the Singleton Pattern. What is it?

It means the singleton instance is created only when it's first requested (not when the class is loaded), improving performance if the instance might not be used.

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.5

- **Logger** - single logging system
- **Database connection pool** - shared connection management
- **Configuration manager** - global application settings
- **Cache** - shared data storage
- **Print spooler** - manage print jobs
- **User account** — many instances are needed, not a singleton  

These are common real-world examples where Singleton is used. Which is wrong?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.6

1. **Global state** - makes testing difficult
2. **Hidden dependencies** - unclear what code depends on it
3. **Violates Single Responsibility** - manages its own creation + business logic
4. **Difficult to extend** - hard to subclass or modify
5. **Thread safety issues** - complex to implement correctly
6. **Improves performance** — Singleton doesn't guarantee faster execution  

These are the main criticisms of the Singleton pattern. Which is wrong?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.7

What is a better alternative to Singleton pattern in modern programming?

---

**Answer:**


---

## Question 5.8

This is wrong way of using the Singleton. Rewrite the code.

```python
# Wrong way
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()
print(s1 is s2)  

# Right way
s1 = Singleton.??()
s2 = Singleton.??()
print(s1 is s2)  
```
