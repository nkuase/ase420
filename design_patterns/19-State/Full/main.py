State Pattern Demo
This example demonstrates the State pattern through a security system
that behaves differently during day and night hours.

Key concepts demonstrated:
1. State-dependent behavior without complex conditional statements
2. Clean state transitions based on external events (time changes)
3. Encapsulation of state-specific behavior in separate classes
4. Polymorphic delegation to state objects
