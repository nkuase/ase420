---

## Question 3.1

(T/F) We must design software, as it always reduces complexity. (Hint: Do you design software if you need to write "Hello World"?)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.2

What problems arise from keeping separate lists to track related data (like employee names and salaries)?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.3

(Hint: This is the first of the APIE OOP Principles)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.6

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.7

What is the "rule of three" in software development and how does it relate to inheritance?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.8

Explain why if/else is a code smell?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.9

How does inheritance eliminate code duplication? Explain the idea simply.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.10

1. **Code reuse**: Inherit existing functionality from parent classes
2. **Extend functionality**: Add new features to existing classes
3. **Override behavior**: Modify specific behaviors while keeping others
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to common code only need to be made in one place
5. **Reduce Coupling**: Removes Coupling to separate subclasses and a super class

These are the benefits of this inheritance. Which of them is not correct?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.11

Whenever we need to change our code, we do not change it in a hurry. Instead, what should we do? (Hint: What is the next step of Define, before the Development?)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.12

What does DRY stand for?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.13

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.14

This is a list of the benefits of Separation of Concerns. What item is wrong?

- Each module has a clear, single purpose
- Changes in one area don't affect others
- Easier to test and debug
- Team members can work on different sections independently
- Code becomes more modular and maintainable
- Each module has more interfaces with other modules

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.15

What are two concepts to enable the "Separation of Concerns"? (Hint: What is software design?)

**Answer:**
