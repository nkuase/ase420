# Q1. OOP and Software Design

---

## Question 1.1

When we debug code, we find that we are experiencing "One step forward, two steps back". What is the best solution to this issue?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.2

Why do we need Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Software Design? (Hint: What's the name of the game?)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.3

(T/F) We use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** because it is a proven way to manage complexity effectively across a wide range of problem domains.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.4

1. Managing modules becomes costly
2. Cannot respond quickly to users' requests
3. Introducing more bugs when fixing existing bugs
4. Increased coupling and dependencies among modules
5. Code becomes hard to read and manage

(T/F) These are the problems that arise when we develop software without proper design (ad-hoc development).

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.5

This is the typical evolution of a software project from a small script to a complex system.

1. **??1**: Write a small script to solve a problem
2. **??2**: Script becomes hard to manage, so we break it into smaller parts
3. **Growing complexity**: Add more modules, couplings, and increasing dependencies
4. **Management problems**: Very quickly, managing modules becomes costly

What are ??# (Hint: we should start small and then split into modules)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.6

What is the main cause of complexity? (Hint: it also starts with C)

---

**Answers:**

---

## Question 1.7

(T/F) Real-world software is not complex at all, but bad design makes it unnecessarily complex.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Questions 8

Software design is about A and B.

What are A and B?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.9

(T/F) High coupling makes code harder to change, test, and maintain
(T/F) Good design aims to reduce unnecessary coupling

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.10

Which explains **coupling** and **dependencies**?

- ??1: How much one module depends on or is connected to another module
- ??2: When one module needs another module to function properly

---

??1 -> coupling
??2 -> dependencies

---

## Question 1.11

What are APIE (the four columns of OOP)?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.12

Good software design directly improves maintainability by:

- Making code easier to understand and modify
- Reducing the risk of introducing bugs during changes
- Creating a modular structure that can be tested independently
- Providing clear interfaces between components
- Adds more cost to the code each time

What is wrong?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.13

There are two types of code we need to avoid. The first one is rigid code. What is the other one?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 1.14

We can sense that something is wrong with the problem indicators. What do we call that?

---

**Answer:**
