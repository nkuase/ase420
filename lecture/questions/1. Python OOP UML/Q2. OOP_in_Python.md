# Q2. OOP in Python

---

## Question 2.1

Why don't we need to use the `new` operator to instantiate an object in Python?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.2

What is the purpose of `__init__(self)` in Python classes? 
In Java, what should we use to do the same thing?

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.3

Write a Python class `Car` with attributes `brand`, `model`, and `year` using the `__init__` method with default values.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.4

What happens when you print an object in Python by default, and how can you customize it?

---

**Answer:**

---

The difference between `__str__` and `__repr__` in Python is that `__str__` is intended to provide a readable, user-friendly string representation of an object, useful for display to end users, while `__repr__` is meant to provide an unambiguous string representation aimed at developers, ideally one that can be used to recreate the object.

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Book(title={self.title!r}, author={self.author!r})"
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"

b = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
print(repr(b))  # Output: Book(title='1984', author='George Orwell')
print(str(b))   # Output: 1984 by George Orwell
```

---

## Question 2.5

We have a Car class. Write code to override the `__eq__` method for comparing two `Car` objects based on their attributes. Use the hint if necessary:

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, Car):
        return False
    return (self.brand ...)
```

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.6

What are the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming? (Hint: What does the acronym APIE mean?)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.7

What does "one message, different actions" mean? ( Different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations.)

```python
class Dog:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Same method call, different behavior
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.make_sound())  # Polymorphic behavior
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.8

In Python (and other dynamic languages), we can interpret polymorphism as:  
*A form of polymorphism where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of methods/attributes, not its type.*  

What concept expresses this idea? (If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.9

This OOP idea models hierarchical relationships where subclasses inherit properties from superclasses. Superclasses are general, subclasses are specific.

```python
class Vehicle:    # Superclass (general)
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

class Car(Vehicle):    # Subclass (specific)
    def __init__(self, brand, doors):
        super().__init__(brand)
        self.doors = doors
```

What is this OOP idea?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.10

(T/F) We can use inheritance to remove duplication, as we can make a superclass that has the common code and inherit from the class to make different subclasses.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.11

In this Python code, we don't expose the member field _balance (private), but use the get_balance function to access the field. What is this OOP technique called?

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self._balance = balance  # Protected attribute
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance
```

----

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.12

Explain why encapsulation is important? (Hint: change & complexity from the change)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.13

In OOP programming, we make methods public and fields private. What is the OOP idea to express this idea?

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2.14

Create a simple class hierarchy demonstrating inheritance with a `Shape` superclass and `Circle` subclass. 
- The Shape has a (private) member field _color and its accessor method get_color.
- It has the area method (empty), but subclasses will implement it.
