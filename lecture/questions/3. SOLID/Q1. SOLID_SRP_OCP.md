# Q1. SOLID Principles - SRP and OCP

---

## Question 1

What does the SOLID acronym stand for, and who coined these principles?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2

You see a module that does five things (five responsibilities). What SOLID principle does it violate?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3

You see a module that is not extensible using plugins or similar. What SOLID principle would you use to refactor this code?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 4

You see a class and its subclass that will break because the subclass method won't work under some conditions. What SOLID principle does this subclass violate?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 5

You see an interface that has tons of unrelated methods. What SOLID principle would you use to refactor this code?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6

You see a class that accesses concrete (subclass) classes directly, not using interfaces. What SOLID principle would you use to refactor this code?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 7

- Avoid **rigid code** (hard to refactor for changes)
- Avoid **fragile code** (easy to break with changes)
- Build "dependency firewalls" to make modules independent
- Structure software to allow **extend, change, and delete** parts without affecting other parts
- Make programs simple and small

This is a list of the main goals of SOLID principles.
Which one is wrong?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 8

What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and why is it important?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 9

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
    
    def calculate_pay(self):
        return self.salary * 12
    
    def save_to_database(self):  # Different responsibility!
        # database logic here
        pass
```

Explain why this class violates SRP and show how to fix it.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 10

What is the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 11

```python
def print_employee(e):
    if isinstance(e, Manager):
        print(f"Manager: {e.name}")
    elif isinstance(e, Programmer):
        print(f"Programmer: {e.name}")
    # Adding a new type requires modifying this code!
```

This is the code that violates OCP.
Explain what the code smell of this code is and why it is problematic in terms of changing and extending the feature?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 12

```python
class Employee:
    def get_info(self):
        pass

class Manager(Employee):
    def get_info(self):
        return f"Manager: {self.name}"

class Programmer(Employee):
    def get_info(self):
        return f"Programmer: {self.name}"

# Usage - no type checking needed:
for employee in employees:
    print(employee.get_info())  # Polymorphic call
```

This is an example of using polymorphism to solve OCP violations. Explain how this code can solve the OCP violation.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 13

1. **Easy Extension**: Adding new types (like `Programmer` class) doesn't require changing existing code - just create a new class and override polymorphic methods

2. **Easy Removal**: Can safely delete classes (like `Manager`) without impacting other code - no need to remove if/else statements

These are the two main advantages of following OCP. But think about the danger of using this technique (Hint: Does this approach make the code simple or complex? Do we really need this code when we have only two types?)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 14

- No `isinstance()` or type checking in business logic
- New features added by creating new classes, not modifying existing ones
- Polymorphic methods are used instead of conditional statements
- Can add/remove types without touching existing code

This is a list of the benefits of using this principle. What is this principle?

How do you know if your code follows

**Answer:**

---

## Question 15

What is the key technique for implementing OCP, and what principle should you remember?
(Hint: It is P in APIE)
