    Main function demonstrating the State Design Pattern using PyQt6.
    
    This example shows a security system that behaves differently based on
    the current state (daytime vs nighttime). The same user actions produce
    different behaviors depending on the time of day.
    
    Educational Value:
    - Demonstrates the State pattern in a real-world scenario
    - Shows how state transitions can be automatic (time-based)
    - Illustrates how the same interface can have different implementations
    - Combines State pattern with Singleton pattern for state management
